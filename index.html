We been on some dumb shit lately<br>
Finding love in the worst place to be<br>
Different dudes in the party<br>
Finding no truth<br>
'Cause they lyin<br>
      <br> 
Hitttin up girls but you want me<br>
So I entertain em boys say I'm lonely<br>
But I figured I need real I hate empty<br>
Want a real thing<br>
Not some dumb fling<br>
<br>
Is it simply the buzz from the liquor?<br>
Butterflies on your neck make me quiver<br>
Is it true cause I hear all the rumors<br>
      <br>
But I gotta ask<br>
How you make me act like this oh no?<br>
How you make me act like this oh no?<br>
How you make me trip like this oh no?<br>
Tho this ain't new to me<br>
I ain't used to this<br>
      <br>
      How you make me act like this oh no? <br>
How you make me act like this oh no? <br>
How you make me trip like this oh no? <br>
Tho this ain't new to me <br>
I ain't used to this <br>
 <br>
Lookin at you boy I see that you're one of a kind <br>
Tatted up, a pretty smile <br>
Your body buff, your sleezy lines <br>
Player playin all his games <br>
But I see thru you and your fade <br>
Yeah you fuckboy and your chains <br>
They ain't gon make me run away <br>
 <br>
But have you had a girl like me <br>
Give a taste of loyalty? <br>
Have you had a girl like me no, no, no <br>
 <br>
But I gotta ask <br>
How you make me act like this oh no? <br>
How you make me act like this oh no? <br>
How you make me trip like this oh no? <br>
Tho this ain't new to me <br>
I ain't used to this <br>
 <br>
How you make me act like this oh no? <br>
How you make me act like this oh no? <br>
How you make me trip like this oh no? <br>
Tho this ain't new to me <br>
I ain't used to this <br>
 <br>
Used to this fantasy, no <br>
Used to this fallacy <br>
I ain't used to <br>
I ain't used to this <br>
 <br>
